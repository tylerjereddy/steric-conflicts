Purpose of module: Demonstrate utility of Python multiprocessing module for analysis of a single coordinate file with MDAnalysis. This module is also a useful general piece of code for analyzing a system that may have 'questionable contacts--' steric issues with atoms potentially too close together for any number of reasons (perhaps the most common use case would be after the construction of a complex system).

#We normally parse coordinate files with MDAnalysis as Universe objects, but these contain open files and cannot easily be passed between cores, so instead each core will launch the same analysis function with a different set of arguments, load a copy of the universe object, perform the analysis on the subset of the coordinates specified in the arguments, and finally return the results to the parent process for aggregation with results from other cores

def perform_portion_of_steric_analysis_on_individual_core(coord_file, species_start_index, species_end_index, particles_per_residue,cutoff=2.0):
    '''Each core will individually load the universe object (as it cannot be passed between them) and produce distance array data for a subset of the index range of interest.
    The arguments:
    coord_file : is a string containing the path to the single coordinate file being parsed
    species_start_index : is the atom index for the first particle to be parsed by THIS core
    species_end_index : is the atom index for the last particle to be parsed by THIS core
    particles_per_residue : is the number of particles in a given residue (i.e., 13 for coarse-grained POPC in MARTINI) so that the code can stride through and assess contacts around a single residue at a time    cutoff : the farthest a particle can be from a given residue to be counted as a proximal contact (measured in A)
    *Note: this code assumes that the indices of a given species are contiguous in the coordinate file.'''
    #use the multiprocessing module to print the name of the current process, so that we can monitor progress at the terminal:
    print multiprocessing.current_process().name, 'Starting' 
    #as usual with MDAnalysis, we produce a Universe object in order to do most of our work, and this will be done on each core individually as there's no easy way to pass Universe objects (which contain open files) between cores:
    input_universe = MDAnalysis.Universe(coord_file) #again, this will happen on every core that runs this function
    #we'll want to count the number of atoms that are within some cutoff of a given residue, and store all the values calculated on this core in the following list:
    ordered_list_steric_violation_counts = []
    #now we stride through the range of indices for this particular residue (i.e, POPC or DPPC, etc.) and count the number of atoms / particles that fall within the specified cutoff:

    '''Adjust the arrays of indices sent to each core to avoid the splaying of residues across cores. After other code roughly balances out the number of indices to be sent to each core, this function takes the list of index arrays destined for each core and performs an adjustment such that the returned list contains index arrays which only have whole residues--NO splaying of residues between arrays/cores can be tolerated for sensible results. Naturally, it would be much simpler to deal with residue numbers rather than indices in simple cases, but index numbers are often more reliable in extremely large systems or in other coordinate files where there may be non-unique residue numbers.'''

        #it might seem like the above could fail on the last element (last array) in the list, but by definition that array should always be divisible by the particles_per_residue when we get to it because the overall number of indices is also divisible by the number of particles in a residue, so the remaining indices (last element / array) should not require modification
